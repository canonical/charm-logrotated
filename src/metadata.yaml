description: |
  logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate
  large numbers of log files. It allows automatic rotation, compression,
  removal, and mailing of log files. Each log file may be handled daily,
  weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.
  .
  This charm can be deployed alongside principle charms to enable logrotate
  management across deployed services.
